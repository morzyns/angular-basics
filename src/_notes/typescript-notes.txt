-- kill angular running on port 4200 

sudo lsof -t -i tcp:4200 | xargs kill -9


-- deploy and run  the application 
ng serve - angularCLI compiles TS to JS under the hood. 
-- compile using tsc command 
tsc myfile.ts 


-- Modules  in TS  ( not as same as Angular Modules which are different concept altogether)
 
 - in Typescript think of a module as a sort of equivalent of a class .
 - when we use the export keyword on the class, the file becomes a module ( kind of )
 
- define the class as export it so that it can be used in other classes (ex Point.js)
- import the module ( ie the above class), and use it where it is required. 
( ie - use the import statement  in main.ts to makeuse of the Point.ts )

- Note , in TS  we can export NOT ONLY MODULES (IE classes ) ,  BUT ALSO functions, variables, objects
