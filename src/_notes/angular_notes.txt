Modules 
    - ui components are grouped together as modules in Angular 

Components 
    - Create a component , 
        - Register it in a module 
            - Add an element in html markup 


Components in AJS expand the html markup vocabulary 
    
    using  CLI in Angular 

-- creating components. 
    ->  ng g c <<component name >>
    
-- creating services 
    -> ng g s <<service name >></service>    

when we use the leading asterking on a ng directive, then implicity we are 
getting a ng-template to work for us in the backgroun 

ex :


We use DIRECTIVES to modify the underlying DOM Model 

- Structural Directive - those that modify structure of the dom element : 
        - these are  prefixed with a * sign  ... Ex *ngIf  , *ngFor 
        <div *ngIf="courses.length > 0 ; else no Course


- Attribute Directive
